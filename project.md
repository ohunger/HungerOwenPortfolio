# Portfolio Website Project

## Project Overview:
This project involves the creation of a personal portfolio website to showcase my professional achievements and skills. The website will include sections for my projects, job experiences, a resume, and a contact form. Additional functionalities may be added if possible, however I am not very skilled with webdev which is why I think this is a great project to build my skills and also incorporate multiple languages all into one project.

## Feature Specification:
- **Homepage:**
  - Welcome message and brief introduction.
  - Navigation menu for easy access to different sections.
  
- **Projects:**
  - A dedicated section to showcase my past projects.
  - Each project entry should include:
    - Project title and description.
    - Project image or thumbnail.
    - Link to the project (if available).
  
- **Job Experience:**
  - A section to list my work history and experiences.
  - Each job entry should include:
    - Job title and company.
    - A brief description of my role and responsibilities.
  
- **Resume:**
  - An option to download my resume/CV as a PDF.
  
- **Contact Form:**
  - A contact form for visitors to get in touch with you.
  - Fields in the contact form:
    - Name
    - Email
    - Message
  - Upon submission, the form should send an email to my designated address.
  
- **Portfolio Filtering:**
  - Ability to filter projects based on categories or skills.
  
- **Additional Functionalities (TBD/Optional):**
  - I would like for there to be some functionality to change my resume section without actually having to hardcode my resume/job experience into the app/html. 
  - Testimonials section for displaying recommendations.
  - Integration with social media profiles.
  - Analytics to track website usage.
  - Light/dark mode toggle for user preference.
  - Search functionality to find specific projects or content.
  - Maybe add a small section like the google no internet dinosaur jumping game into a tab
  
  
## Technical Specification (Optional):
This website will be built using modern web technologies such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. For dynamic features like the contact form, I might need server-side scripting, using Node.js or PHP (I think I know a couple people who could only make this work using PHP). A responsive and mobile-friendly design will be implemented for a easy user experience across different devices.

I might use the lmu.build to hopefully post this website, as I could actually use this down the road. That would cover the server problem as I wouldn't have to figure out domains etc.

For additional functionalities like a blog or testimonials section, appropriate content management systems (CMS) or third-party platforms could be integrated. 

At the very minimum I will use HTML,CSS,JS,PHP, but most likely I will need to add some other language to complete specific tasks, like if I add a internal short game in a tab.
